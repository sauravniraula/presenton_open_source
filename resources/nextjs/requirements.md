# Visual Editor Implementation Requirements

## Core Functionality
1. Create a new component `PresentationCanvas` using Konva
2. Implement drag and resize functionality for shapes
3. Allow text editing for text elements
4. Sync canvas changes with Redux store
5. Ensure the canvas is responsive and scales appropriately

## Components to Create/Modify
1. PresentationCanvas (new)
2. ShapeEditor (new)
3. TextEditor (new)
4. PresentationEditor (modify to include PresentationCanvas)

## Konva Integration
1. Set up Konva Stage and Layer structure
2. Create Konva shapes based on slide data (Rect, Text, Image, etc.)
3. Implement transformation handlers (resize, rotate)

## Redux Integration
1. Update Redux actions and reducers to handle shape modifications
2. Implement undo/redo functionality

## User Interaction
1. Click-to-select functionality for shapes
2. Double-click to edit text
3. Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Performance Considerations
1. Optimize rendering for complex presentations
2. Implement caching for static elements

## Responsive Design
1. Ensure the canvas scales for different screen sizes
2. Implement zoom and pan functionality

## Synchronization
1. Keep PresentationPlayer and PresentationCanvas in sync
2. Real-time updates between canvas and Redux store

## Error Handling
1. Implement error boundaries
2. Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid shape data)

## Accessibility
1. Ensure keyboard navigation for canvas elements
2. Implement ARIA attributes for canvas elements

## Testing
1. Unit tests for new components and Redux logic
2. Integration tests for canvas-Redux interaction
3. End-to-end tests for user interactions

## Documentation
1. Update component documentation
2. Create usage guidelines for the visual editor
