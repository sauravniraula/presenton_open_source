#                 # Steps
#                 1. Analyze Prompt, and other provided data.
#                 2. Use Slide titles provided in **Titles**.
#                 3. Generate Slide Content for each slide. Make sure it has all the context and information required to create this individual slide from.
#                 4. Select slide type.
#                 5. Select graphs when required from **Graphs**. Don't repeat same graphs in multiple slides unless required by story.
#                 6. Select infographics when required from **Infographics**.
#                 7. Output should be in json format as per given schema.

#                 # Notes
#                 - Generate output in language mentioned in *Input*.
#                 - Distribute contexts mentioned in prompt to slides using **info** field.
#                 - User prompt should be respected beyond all rules or constraints.
#                 - If **Story** is provided, presentation should follow the story flow.
#                 - Infographics and graphs should be prioritized in selection over basic text content.
#                 - Select meaningful graphs and infographics_numbers that align with the story/content of the slide.
#                 - If infographics is selected for a slide, then slide type should be **10** or **11**.
#                 - When you have to express single numbers like percentage or figures, you should use inforgraphics but for a collection of numbers in series you can use charts.
#                 - Graphs and infographics selected for a slide should be coherent with the story/content in the slide.
#                 - Number of data in a series and categories in graphs should be same.
#                 - Freely select type with images and icons.
#                 - Introduction and Conclusion should have *Type 1* if graph is not assigned.
#                 - Try to select **different types for every slides**.

#                 - Do not include same graph twice in presentation without any changes to the other.
#                 - Every series in a graph should have data in same unit. Example: all series should be in percentage or all series should be in number of items.
#                 - Type **9** and **5** should be only picked if graph is available.
#                 - All numbers should be from the give text/graphs. **Do not assume or guess numbers/data.**
#                 - For slide content follow these rules:

#                     - Adhere to length contraints in **body** and **description**. Focus on direct communication within character constrainsts than lengthy explanation.
#                     - **body** and **description** in slides should never exceed character limits of 200 characters.
#                     - Specify **don't include text in image** in image prompt.
#                     - All the numbers should be bolded with **bold** tag in body or description of slide.

#                         - a humanoid robot standing tall, gazing confidently at the horizon, bathed in warm sunlight, the background showing a futuristic cityscape with sleek buildings and flying vehicles
#                     - Descriptions should be clear and to the point.
#                     - Descriptions should not use words like "This slide", "This presentation".
#                     - If **body** contains items, *choose number of items randomly between mentioned constraints.*
#                     - **Icon queries** must be a generic **single word noun**.
#                     - Provide 3 icon query for each icon where,
#                         - First one should be specific like "Led bulb".
#                         - Second one should be more generic that first like "bulb".
#                         - Third one should be simplest like "light".
#                     - In case of infographics,
#                         - **for a slide all infographics chart should be same**. This is very important point to adhere to. Adhere to it compulsorily.
#                         - You should obey the schema for partcular infographics chart. Value of infographics chart should be in schema suggested format.
#                         - In cases like this: for example all previous infographics charts are of type 'radial-progress' and data is numerical then either convert it into percentage to show 'radial-progress' or don't include the chart.
#                         - Never use numerical data with charts like 'radial-progress' or others which requires percentage of fraction type and don't use percentage with text infographic chart.
#                         - Try not including data point in a slide which do not adhere to above points.
#                     - In graph,
#                         - Make sure meaningful data is given out.
#                         - You may pick data points for clarity when there are lots of data points.
#                         - **Only numbers should be given out in graph data. Don't include text/string in data.**
#                         - Number of items in categories should be same as number of data points in series.
#                         - Don't give out empty or zero valued data.
#                         - **Change slide type to other type if above points are not satisfied.**

#                 **Go through notes and steps and make sure they are all followed. Rule breaks are strictly not allowed.**
