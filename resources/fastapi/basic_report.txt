## Research Report: Economic Impact of USAID's Defunding on Nepal

### Introduction

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been a significant contributor to Nepal's development since 1951, providing over $3.8 billion in aid. However, recent decisions to freeze or reduce USAID funding have substantial implications for Nepal's economic and social sectors. This report analyzes the economic impact of USAID's defunding on Nepal, focusing on key sectors such as health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure.

### Background

USAID's involvement in Nepal spans multiple sectors, including health, education, agriculture, infrastructure, economic growth, humanitarian aid, and women and children empowerment. The agency's Country Development Cooperation Strategy for Nepal (2020-2025) aims to create a more self-reliant, prosperous, and inclusive society by improving democratic governance and health and education outcomes[1].

### Economic Impact

1. **Sectoral Impacts:**
   - **Health:** The USAID Health Direct Financing Project, with a budget of $25 million, aimed to improve healthcare services. The freeze jeopardizes essential healthcare improvements[2][5].
   - **Education:** The USAID Education Direct Financing Project, valued at up to $85 million over five years, faces uncertainty, affecting marginalized youth and early-grade students[2][5].
   - **Agriculture:** The $21 million Agricultural Direct Financing Project, designed to enhance food security, is now on hold[2][5].
   - **Infrastructure and Economic Development:** While USAID has contributed significantly to infrastructure and economic projects, recent suspensions have mixed outcomes[3].

2. **Employment and Fiscal Impact:**
   - The aid freeze affects over 300 NGOs and consultancies, impacting thousands of Nepali professionals[4][5].
   - The reduction in USAID funding has created a fiscal gap equivalent to 1.6% of Nepal's GDP in 2024, severely affecting rural healthcare and climate adaptation programs[4].

3. **Geopolitical and Strategic Implications:**
   - USAID's role in Nepal reflects broader geopolitical dynamics, with the U.S. reassessing its aid strategies amidst rising influence from China and Russia[3].
   - Nepal's transition from a Least Developed Country (LDC) to a developing nation by 2026 necessitates self-reliance and reduced dependence on foreign aid[3][4].

### Metrics and Data

- **Total USAID Aid to Nepal:** Over $3.8 billion since 1951[4].
- **Recent Annual Funding:** $411 million in the last fiscal year, with a significant decrease to $85 million by December 2024[2][4].
- **Affected Projects:** At least four major projects are stalled, including health, agriculture, education, and inclusive policy initiatives[5].
- **Employment Impact:** Thousands of jobs in health, education, and agriculture sectors are affected[4].

### Conclusion

The defunding of USAID projects in Nepal has profound economic implications, disrupting vital sectors like health, education, and agriculture. As Nepal prepares to graduate from LDC status, it must navigate these challenges by fostering self-reliance and diversifying its aid sources. The government's efforts to secure alternative funding and reallocate resources are crucial to mitigating the immediate impacts of the aid freeze.

### Recommendations

1. **Diversify Aid Sources:** Nepal should explore alternative donors to fill the funding gaps.
2. **Self-Reliance Strategies:** Invest in sustainable economic development and reduce dependence on foreign aid.
3. **Geopolitical Engagement:** Carefully manage geopolitical relationships to leverage aid effectively without compromising national interests.

### Future Outlook

Nepal's economic resilience will depend on its ability to adapt to the changing landscape of foreign aid. By focusing on sustainable growth and strategic partnerships, Nepal can navigate the challenges posed by USAID's defunding and emerge stronger in its transition to a developing nation.
